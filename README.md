Sure, let's expand the README to include the decrypted messages we obtained through the initial process and explain the hypothesis testing and the partial decryption with the known key part "Bitcoin: A purely peer-to-peer".

Here's the updated README:

# XOR Cipher Decryption

This project demonstrates the process of decrypting multiple ciphertexts that were XOR-encrypted with the same key. The key is partially known, and we aim to extract as much of the key as possible and use it to decrypt the messages.

## Steps

### Step 1: Convert Hex Strings to Byte Vectors

First, we convert the given hex-encoded ciphertexts to byte vectors.

```rust
let ciphertexts: Vec<Vec<u8>> = ciphertext_hex.iter().map(|&hex| hex_to_bytes(hex)).collect();
let min_len = ciphertexts.iter().map(|c| c.len()).min().expect("No ciphertexts provided");
```

### Step 2: Initialize Key and Potential Keys

We initialize a key vector and a potential keys matrix. The `potential_keys` matrix will store potential keys for each byte position.

```rust
let mut key = vec![0u8; min_len];
let mut potential_keys = vec![vec![0; 256]; min_len];
```

### Step 3: XOR Ciphertexts in Pairs

We XOR each pair of ciphertexts and record potential keys for each position where the XOR result is an ASCII alphabetic character.

```rust
for i in 0..ciphertexts.len() {
    for j in i + 1..ciphertexts.len() {
        let xored = xor_buffers(&ciphertexts[i][..min_len], &ciphertexts[j][..min_len]);
        for k in 0..xored.len() {
            if xored[k].is_ascii_alphabetic() {
                potential_keys[k][ciphertexts[i][k] as usize ^ b' ' as usize] += 1;
                potential_keys[k][ciphertexts[j][k] as usize ^ b' ' as usize] += 1;
            }
        }
    }
}

### Step 4: Decrypt approximately the Messages

```rust
for (i, ciphertext) in ciphertexts.iter().enumerate() {
    let decrypted_message: Vec<u8> = xor_buffers(&ciphertext[..min_len], &key);
    let decrypted_text = bytes_to_string(&decrypted_message);
    println!("Decrypted message {}: {}", i, decrypted_text);
}
```

### Initial Results

Using the above steps, we obtained the following decrypted messages:

1. **Decrypted message 0**: `.he ...es 03 Fan/2009 Chacceal`
2. **Decrypted message 1**: `.ove...ents n~e good at cxttdn`
3. **Decrypted message 2**: `.itc... is g}iat as a for` ok`
4. **Decrypted message 3**: `.n o...r to gmve a decentaldz`
5. **Decrypted message 4**: `.s s...ety bjoomes more acd `o`
6. **Decrypted message 5**: `. be... to rjmlize new po~sioi`
7. **Decrypted message 6**: `.ryp...urrenlees allowed con c`
8. **Decrypted message 7**: `.ot ...r key|  Not your cbin~.`
9. **Decrypted message 8**: `.itc...: A pz~ely peer-to pehr`

### Step 5: Hypothesis Testing

We hypothesized that the beginning of the key is "Bitcoin: A purely peer-to-peer ". Using this known part of the key, we decrypted as much of the messages as possible.

### Partial Decryption with Known Key Part

Using the known part of the key, we decrypted the ciphertexts as follows:

```rust
let key = "Bitcoin: A purely peer-to-peer ";
let key_bytes = key.as_bytes();

for (index, ciphertext) in ciphertexts.iter().enumerate() {
    let mut decrypted_message = Vec::new();
    for (i, &byte) in ciphertext.iter().take(key_bytes.len()).enumerate() {
        let key_byte = key_bytes[i % key_bytes.len()];
        decrypted_message.push(byte ^ key_byte);
    }
    if let Ok(decrypted_str) = str::from_utf8(&decrypted_message) {
        println!("Decrypted message {}: {}", index, decrypted_str);
    } else {
        println!("Decrypted message {} contains non-UTF-8 characters", index);
    }
}
```

### Results with Known Key Part

Using the partial key "Bitcoin: A purely peer-to-peer ", we obtained the following decrypted messages:

1. **Decrypted message 0**: `The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancello`
2. **Decrypted message 1**: `Governments are good at cutting`
3. **Decrypted message 2**: `Bitcoin is great as a form of d`
4. **Decrypted message 3**: `In order to have a decentralize`
5. **Decrypted message 4**: `As society becomes more and mor`
6. **Decrypted message 5**: `I began to realize new possibil`
7. **Decrypted message 6**: `Cryptocurrencies allowed non-cu`
8. **Decrypted message 7**: `Not your keys, Not your coins.`
9. **Decrypted message 8**: `Bitcoin: A purely peer-to-peer`

These partial decryption validate our hypothesis about the key and provide more context to the messages.

### Step 6: Extending the Key
After the space "Bitcoin: A purely peer-to-peer ", we tried all letters of the alphabet until reaching the letter 'V', which made sense. This extended the key to "Bitcoin: A purely peer-to-peer V".

### Results with Extended Key Part
Using the extended key part, we obtained the following decrypted messages:

1. **Decrypted message** 0: The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor
2. **Decrypted message** 1: Governments are good at cutting
3. **Decrypted message** 2: Bitcoin is great as a form of di
4. **Decrypted message** 3: In order to have a decentralized
5. **Decrypted message** 4: As society becomes more and more
6. **Decrypted message** 5: I began to realize new possibili
7. **Decrypted message** 6: Cryptocurrencies allowed non-cus
8. **Decrypted message** 7: Not your keys, Not your coins.
9. **Decrypted message** 8: Bitcoin: A purely peer-to-peer v

### Step 7: Extending the Key again
We then tried the word "version" to further extend the key, resulting in the following decrypted messages:

1. **Decrypted message** 0: The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on bri
